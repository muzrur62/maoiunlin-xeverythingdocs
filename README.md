Description
Thank you for downloading the Maoimun Linüx project.
MAOİMUN (MAOİNTİN OF MUNZUR) is an Ubuntu-based Linux distribution.
Its goals are privacy and simplicity.
For privacy reasons, we did not include our own APT mirrors by default, but you can learn how to set them up using the howmakeaptmiror.txt file in the documentation directory if you wish.
For simplicity, we provide a pure GNOME experience. To avoid copyright issues, we have included a few custom theme packages and our own signatures.
